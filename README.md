Sublime Text "import-use"
==========================

Package that reads the vendor/* folder, finds the appropiate namespace and imports it to the current file.

Select the portion of class you want to import (for example, "Request"), press Ctrl+Shift+u, and a dialog window with all matching namespaces will appear (for example, "Zend\Http\Request" or "Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request"). Choose one and you're done :)
